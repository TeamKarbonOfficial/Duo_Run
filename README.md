~ A Lib GDX Experiment ~

**NOTE: TO CHECK FOR COLLISION, USE**
```java
Intersect.overlapConvexPolygons();//!!!!
```
That's all folks...

*TODO:*
- Make the obstacles.  *done*
- Make them work.
- Find out a way to check for collisions *done*
- Actually check for collisions
- Make an endgame situation function
- Create levels
- Create a level select screen
- Create a main menu screen
- Have some options/whatever
- Test it on other devices too (to make sure the resolutions work and that the graphics aren't off-screen)
