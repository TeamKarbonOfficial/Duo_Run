~ A Lib GDX Experiment ~

**NOTE: TO CHECK FOR COLLISION, USE Intersect.overlapConvexPolygons!!!**
That's all folks...

*TODO:*
- Make the obstacles.
- Find out a way to check for collisions
- Make an endgame situation function
- Create levels
- Create a level select screen
- Create a main menu screen
- Have some options/whatever
- Test it on other devices too (to make sure the resolutions work and that the graphics aren't off-screen)
